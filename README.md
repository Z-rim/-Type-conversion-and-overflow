C  Type conversion and overflow

the first program will prints out the minimum and maximum values of various data types (char, short, int, long, float, and double) and demonstrates overflow for integer types by adding 1 to the maximum integer value.

the second program will continuously increment `i` until `i` is not equal to `j`. Once that condition is met, it will print the values of `i` and `j`. 
Here's a C program that demonstrates the minimal and maximal values of various data types and shows overflow issues for integer types:
